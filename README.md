# Do below steps to Copy your file from Source Folder to Destination Folder

1. Execute command --> npm install
2. Open Copy.js file and provide correct Source and Destination folder Path
3. Execute command --> npm run

We are using npm package ncp (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncp) for copying files asynchronously.

The default behavior is to complete as many copies as possible, logging errors along the way.
